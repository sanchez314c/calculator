- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission**

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
