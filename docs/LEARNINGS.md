# Learning Journey: Calculator

## 🎯 What I Set Out to Learn
- Electron desktop application development
- Cross-platform build systems
- Modern JavaScript and CSS practices
- Calculator logic implementation
- User interface design for desktop applications

## 💡 Key Discoveries
### Technical Insights
- Electron provides excellent cross-platform compatibility
- CSS Grid and Flexbox work well for calculator layouts
- Proper event handling is crucial for calculator functionality
- Dark themes require careful color contrast considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- Chose Electron for cross-platform desktop support
- Used vanilla JavaScript for simplicity and performance
- Implemented modular CSS for maintainable styling
- Created clean separation between UI and calculation logic

## 🚧 Challenges Faced
### Challenge 1: Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Problem**: Ensuring consistent behavior across macOS, Windows, and Linux
**Solution**: Used Electron's built-in cross-platform APIs and tested on all platforms
**Time Spent**: 2 hours

### Challenge 2: Calculator Logic Precision
**Problem**: Handling floating-point precision issues in calculations
**Solution**: Implemented proper rounding and precision handling
**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## 📚 Resources That Helped
- [Electron Documentation](https://electronjs.org/docs) - Comprehensive framework docs
