## 📋 Overview

This directory contains archived documentation, deprecated guides, and historical content that is no longer current but may be useful for reference or historical context.

## 🗂️ Archive Organization

### By Date
Documentation is archived with date prefixes to maintain chronological order:

- `YYYY-MM-DD_filename.md` - Date-specific archived content
- `vX.X.X_filename.md` - Version-specific archived content

### By Category
Legacy content is organized by type:

- **Architecture**: Old system designs and technical decisions
- **Guides**: Deprecated user and developer guides
- **API**: Obsolete API documentation
- **Process**: Former development workflows and procedures

## 📖 Currently No Legacy Content

As this is the initial standardization of the project, there is no legacy documentation to archive at this time.

Future legacy content may include:

### When Content Becomes Legacy
- **Major Version Changes**: Documentation for previous major versions
- **Architecture Refactors**: Old system designs when architecture changes
- **Deprecated Features**: Documentation for removed functionality
- **Process Changes**: Old development workflows when processes evolve

### Archive Triggers
Content is moved to legacy when:
- A new major version introduces breaking changes
- Features are deprecated and removed
- Development processes are significantly updated
- Architecture undergoes major refactoring
- Documentation is replaced with significantly different approaches

## 🔍 Accessing Legacy Content

### Search and Reference
When looking for historical information:
1. **Check Version**: Identify which version the content relates to
2. **Review Changelog**: Check [CHANGELOG.md](../../dev/CHANGELOG.md) for context
3. **Cross-reference**: Compare with current documentation
4. **Version Control**: Use git history for detailed change tracking

### Migration Path
If you need to reference legacy content:
- Current documentation should always be the primary reference
- Legacy content is for historical context only
- If legacy content contains needed information missing from current docs, consider updating current documentation

## 📅 Archive Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
Legacy content is reviewed periodically to:
- Remove content that is no longer relevant
- Ensure historical accuracy
- Maintain appropriate organization
- Update cross-references

### Retention Policy
- **Recent Legacy** (< 2 years): Maintained for reference
- **Historical Legacy** (2-5 years): Kept for major changes only
- **Ancient Legacy** (> 5 years): Removed unless historically significant
